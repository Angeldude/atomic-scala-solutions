/*{oldDescription}
 1.	Create a class with three methods: the first checks only preconditions, the second checks only postconditions, and the third checks both. Each method has the same body: it takes a String argument which must be between 4-10 characters, and each of those characters must represent a digit. Each method converts each digit into an Int and then adds up all the digits to produce the result. The postcondition should check the result to verify that it is in the expected range of values.
