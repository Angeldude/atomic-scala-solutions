/*{oldDescription}
2.    Write an App (see Applications) with a method that takes the command-line argument of a String of letters, converts it to lowercase, and then converts each character to its numerical value in the alphabet, with ‘a’ being 1, ‘b’ being 2, etc. Sum the values and display the result. Use preconditions to verify that the input is in the correct form, and postconditions to ensure that the result is in the expected range of values.
