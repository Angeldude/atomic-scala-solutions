/*{oldDescription}
6.  Create a type class trait called Transformer with a method convert, but Transformer takes two type parameters: the type it's converting from, and the type it's converting to. Write a method transform that takes any object and its associated Transformer and converts the object. Create several classes and their associated Transformers and show that your type class system works correctly.
